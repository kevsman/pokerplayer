GPU-accelerated CFR trainer for poker bot.
This version implements a recursive CFR algorithm for No-Limit Hold'em,
supporting up to 6 players and configurable blinds. It's based on the principles
from the article: https://medium.com/@olegostroumov/worlds-first-poker-solver-6b1dbe80d0ee
but adapted for the more complex game of No-Limit Hold'em.
