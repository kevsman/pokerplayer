This script is responsible for the offline training of the poker bot using Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR).
It simulates games where the bot plays against itself, learns from its regrets, and stores the resulting
strategies in a JSON file for the real-time bot to use.

Enhanced with GPU acceleration support for faster training.
