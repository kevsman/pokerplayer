## ðŸ”§ INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Main Integration Flow

```python
def make_postflop_decision(...):
    # 1. Standard Setup
    street = game_stage
    pot_commitment_ratio = calculate_commitment()

    # 2. ADVANCED ENHANCEMENTS INTEGRATION
    advanced_context = {}

    # 2a. Advanced Opponent Modeling
    if ADVANCED_MODULES_AVAILABLE and opponent_tracker:
        analyzer = AdvancedOpponentAnalyzer()
        exploitative_strategy = analyzer.get_exploitative_strategy(...)
        advanced_context['opponent_analysis'] = exploitative_strategy

    # 2b. Enhanced Board Analysis
    if ADVANCED_MODULES_AVAILABLE:
        board_analyzer = EnhancedBoardAnalyzer(community_cards)
        board_analysis = board_analyzer.get_comprehensive_analysis()
        advanced_context['board_analysis'] = board_analysis

    # 2c. Performance Monitoring Setup
    if ADVANCED_MODULES_AVAILABLE:
        perf_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
        advanced_context['performance_tracker'] = perf_tracker

    # 3. Enhanced Decision Logic with Advanced Context
    # ... existing decision logic enhanced with advanced_context

    # 4. Advanced Bet Sizing Adjustments
    bet_adjustment_factor = 1.0

    if 'opponent_analysis' in advanced_context:
        # Adjust based on opponent tendencies
        if opp_analysis['recommended_action'] == 'bet_larger':
            bet_adjustment_factor *= 1.2

    if 'board_analysis' in advanced_context:
        # Adjust based on board texture
        if board_texture == 'very_wet':
            bet_adjustment_factor *= 1.1  # Protection betting
        elif board_texture == 'very_dry':
            bet_adjustment_factor *= 0.9  # Induce calls

    # 5. Final Decision with Monitoring
    # ... apply bet_adjustment_factor to all bet sizing

    # 6. Performance Recording
    if 'performance_tracker' in advanced_context:
        perf_tracker.record_decision_quality(quality_score, decision_result)

    return final_action, final_amount
```
