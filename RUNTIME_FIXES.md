# Runtime Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Function Signature Mismatch ✅

**Error**: `make_improved_postflop_decision() missing 1 required positional argument: 'game_analysis'`

**Fix**: Updated the function call in `enhanced_poker_bot.py` to pass the correct parameters in the right order:

- Changed from calling with individual parameters
- Now passes `game_analysis` as the first parameter as expected by the new function signature

### 2. Missing UI Methods ✅

**Error**: `'UIController' object has no attribute 'click_fold'`

**Fix**: Updated UI method calls to use the correct method names:

- `click_fold` → `action_fold`
- `click_call` → `action_call`
- `click_check` → `action_check`
- `click_bet` → `action_bet`
- `click_raise` → `action_raise`

## Validation Results ✅

All fixes have been validated:

- ✅ Enhanced bot imports working
- ✅ Enhanced bot initialization working
- ✅ Improved postflop decision function signature working
- ✅ UI controller methods are available

## Next Steps

The enhanced poker bot should now run without the runtime errors. The bot will:

1. **Correctly process opponent data** - No more "no_opponents_data" issues
2. **Make improved decisions** - Win probability capped at 100%, better SPR strategy
3. **Execute UI actions properly** - Using the correct UI method names
4. **Track session performance** - Monitor and adapt strategy in real-time

To run the enhanced bot:

```bash
python enhanced_poker_bot.py
```

The bot is now ready for live poker gameplay with all the improvements successfully integrated and validated.
