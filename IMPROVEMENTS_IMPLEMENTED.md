# Poker Bot Improvements - June 15, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug: SPR Strategy Function Parameter Error

**Issue**: `should_commit_stack_spr()` function was being called with an incorrect parameter `strategy_recommendation` causing repeated errors in every postflop decision.

**Fix**:

- Fixed the function call in `postflop_decision_logic.py` line 367-371
- Added proper `pot_commitment_ratio` calculation
- Removed the incorrect `strategy_recommendation` parameter

**Impact**: Eliminates all SPR strategy errors and enables proper stack commitment analysis.

### 2. Missing Bot Player Name Configuration

**Issue**: Bot player name was not configured, causing warnings and potential issues with self-identification in action parsing.

**Fix**:

- Added `"bot_player_name": "warriorwonder25"` to `config.json`
- This enables proper self-exclusion in action parsing

**Impact**: Removes warning messages and ensures bot doesn't try to analyze its own actions.

### 3. Syntax Error in C-Betting Logic

**Issue**: Missing line break in postflop decision logic causing syntax error.

**Fix**:

- Fixed indentation and line break issues in medium hand c-betting logic
- Improved c-betting threshold from 0.45 to 0.35 for higher win probability situations

**Impact**: Fixes syntax error and makes c-betting more aggressive when appropriate.

### 4. Conservative Hand Classification

**Issue**: AK on A-high board with 81% win probability was classified as only "medium" instead of "strong".

**Fix**:

- Enhanced hand classification in `enhanced_hand_classification.py`
- One pair with 75%+ win probability now classified as "strong"
- One pair with 60%+ win probability remains "medium"

**Impact**: Better recognition of strong holdings for more aggressive value betting.

### 5. Overly Conservative C-Betting

**Issue**: Bot was not c-betting with strong hands like AK on ace-high boards.

**Fix**:

- Lowered c-betting threshold for medium hands from 45% to 35% win probability
- Made threshold scale better with opponent count
- Improved logic to be more aggressive with high win probability hands

**Impact**: Increased value extraction from strong hands and better pot building.

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Elimination of Errors**: No more SPR strategy errors logged
2. **Better Value Extraction**: More aggressive c-betting with strong hands
3. **Improved Hand Recognition**: Better classification of premium holdings
4. **Cleaner Logging**: No more bot player name warnings
5. **More Balanced Play**: Appropriate aggression with strong hands while maintaining selectivity

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- Reduced error frequency in logs
- Increased c-betting frequency with strong hands (70%+ win probability)
- Better classification of one-pair hands with strong kickers
- No more "Bot player name not configured" warnings

## Files Modified

1. `postflop_decision_logic.py` - Fixed SPR function call and c-betting logic
2. `config.json` - Added bot player name configuration
3. `enhanced_hand_classification.py` - Improved hand strength classification
4. `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md` - This documentation

## Validation Required

1. Run bot and check logs for absence of SPR errors
2. Verify c-betting frequency with strong hands has increased
3. Monitor hand classification accuracy in various board textures
4. Confirm elimination of configuration warnings
