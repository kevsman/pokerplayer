# Poker Bot Improvements - June 15, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug: SPR Strategy Function Parameter Error

**Issue**: `should_commit_stack_spr()` function was being called with an incorrect parameter `strategy_recommendation` causing repeated errors in every postflop decision.

**Fix**:

- Fixed the function call in `postflop_decision_logic.py` line 367-371
- Added proper `pot_commitment_ratio` calculation
- Removed the incorrect `strategy_recommendation` parameter

**Impact**: Eliminates all SPR strategy errors and enables proper stack commitment analysis.

### 2. Missing Bot Player Name Configuration

**Issue**: Bot player name was not configured, causing warnings and potential issues with self-identification in action parsing.

**Fix**:

- Added `"bot_player_name": "warriorwonder25"` to `config.json`
- This enables proper self-exclusion in action parsing

**Impact**: Removes warning messages and ensures bot doesn't try to analyze its own actions.

### 3. Syntax Error in C-Betting Logic

**Issue**: Missing line break in postflop decision logic causing syntax error.

**Fix**:

- Fixed indentation and line break issues in medium hand c-betting logic
- Improved c-betting threshold from 0.45 to 0.35 for higher win probability situations

**Impact**: Fixes syntax error and makes c-betting more aggressive when appropriate.

### 4. Conservative Hand Classification

**Issue**: AK on A-high board with 81% win probability was classified as only "medium" instead of "strong".

**Fix**:

- Enhanced hand classification in `enhanced_hand_classification.py`
- One pair with 75%+ win probability now classified as "strong"
- One pair with 60%+ win probability remains "medium"

**Impact**: Better recognition of strong holdings for more aggressive value betting.

### 6. CRITICAL: Massive Overbet Issue with Marginal Hands

**Issue**: Bot was making huge overbets (like €0.47 with €0.47 stack = 100% all-in) with just top pair on very wet boards with flush draws. This occurred due to:

- Insufficient board texture consideration in hand classification
- Excessive aggression multiplication in bet sizing
- No safety limits for marginal hands on dangerous boards

**Fix**:

- **Enhanced board texture analysis**: One pair on very wet boards now downgraded from "strong/medium" to "weak_made/weak"
- **Bet sizing safety checks**: Added limits to prevent >75% pot bets with marginal hands on wet boards
- **Stack protection**: Never bet >80% of stack with one pair, capped at 60%
- **Improved texture adjustment**: More aggressive downgrades for dangerous board textures

**Impact**: Prevents catastrophic overbets and preserves stack with marginal hands on dangerous boards.

### 7. Enhanced Board Texture Awareness

**Issue**: Bot was not properly adjusting hand strength based on board texture, leading to overvaluation of hands on dangerous boards.

**Fix**:

- Improved `_adjust_for_board_texture()` logic in hand classification
- More aggressive downgrades for one pair and two pair on very wet boards
- Better recognition of flush and straight dangers

**Impact**: More conservative play on dangerous boards, better hand evaluation.

## Expected Performance Improvements

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Elimination of Errors**: No more SPR strategy errors logged
2. **Prevention of Catastrophic Overbets**: No more all-in bets with marginal hands on wet boards
3. **Better Value Extraction**: More aggressive c-betting with strong hands, conservative with marginal hands
4. **Improved Hand Recognition**: Better classification considering board texture
5. **Stack Preservation**: Protection against massive losses with one pair
6. **Cleaner Logging**: No more bot player name warnings
7. **More Balanced Play**: Appropriate aggression with strong hands while maintaining selectivity on dangerous boards

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- Reduced error frequency in logs (especially SPR errors)
- Elimination of >80% stack bets with one pair
- Better hand classification on wet vs dry boards
- Reduced variance from avoiding catastrophic overbets
- Increased c-betting frequency with strong hands (70%+ win probability)
- More conservative play with marginal hands on wet boards
- No more "Bot player name not configured" warnings

## Files Modified

1. `postflop_decision_logic.py` - Fixed SPR function call, c-betting logic, and added bet sizing safety checks
2. `config.json` - Added bot player name configuration
3. `enhanced_hand_classification.py` - Improved hand strength classification and board texture adjustments
4. `IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED.md` - This documentation

## Validation Required

1. Run bot and check logs for absence of SPR errors
2. Verify c-betting frequency with strong hands has increased
3. Monitor hand classification accuracy in various board textures
4. Confirm elimination of configuration warnings
