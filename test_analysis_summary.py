Test Results Analysis and Recommendations for Poker Bot Enhancement

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
================

SUCCESSFULLY FIXED:
✅ DecisionEngine constructor error (was passing HandEvaluator instead of big_blind/small_blind)
✅ Postflop decision logic function signature errors
✅ Indentation and syntax errors
✅ All tests now run without exceptions

CURRENT PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
❌ Win probability always showing 1.000 (equity calculator needs tuning)
❌ Bet to call always 0 (test scenarios need better betting situation setup) 
❌ Some decisions don't match poker theory expectations

GOOD DECISIONS OBSERVED:
✅ Pocket Aces - Raising aggressively (correct)
✅ Full House - Value betting/raising (correct)
✅ Three of a Kind - Value betting (correct)
✅ Two Pair on River - Value betting (correct)

DECISIONS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT:
⚠️  7-2 offsuit "facing large bet" - Should fold but checking (due to bet_to_call=0)
⚠️  Flush draw "facing bet" - Should call but checking (due to bet_to_call=0)
⚠️  A5s vs raise - Being too aggressive (should be more selective)

NEXT STEPS FOR OPTIMIZATION:
============================

1. FIX EQUITY CALCULATOR:
   - Win probabilities should vary realistically (not always 1.000)
   - Implement proper Monte Carlo simulation with realistic opponent ranges
   - Add proper board texture analysis

2. IMPROVE TEST SCENARIOS:
   - Create scenarios with actual bets to call (bet_to_call > 0)
   - Test fold decisions vs large bets
   - Test call decisions with drawing hands
   - Test proper pot odds calculations

3. ENHANCE DECISION LOGIC:
   - Add better hand strength vs bet size analysis
   - Improve preflop ranges (A5s should be more selective vs 3-bets)
   - Add position-based adjustments
   - Implement better bluffing frequency

4. ADD OPPONENT MODELING:
   - Track opponent betting patterns
   - Adjust strategy based on opponent tendencies
   - Implement dynamic strategy adjustments

5. PERFORMANCE METRICS:
   - Add win rate tracking
   - Implement proper bankroll management
   - Add session analysis tools

PRIORITY ORDER:
==============
1. Fix equity calculator for realistic win probabilities
2. Create proper "facing bet" test scenarios  
3. Improve preflop decision making
4. Add position awareness
5. Implement opponent modeling
